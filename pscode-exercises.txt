// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

IF
a = 1

b = 2

a + b = sum


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

if a/b = integer then even
if a/b = %, then odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 4, e = 5

(a + b + c + d + e)/5 = mean

if a < b, c, d, and e, then a is min.

if e > a, b, c, and d, then e is max.

adding numbers from 1 through 5 together then dividing it by 5 gets you the average.

since a = 1, therefore a is the minimum out of the five numbers.

since e = 5, therefore e is the maximum out of the 5 numbers.
